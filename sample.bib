abstract = {Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) can be enhanced in double-channel side-coupled microring resonator structures, generating entangled photons spatially separated in different channels. The enhancement is even more drastic in single-channel side-coupled microring resonator structures, although the generated entangled photons are not spatially separated, and it might be most interesting to use a ring tuned for nondegenerate SPDC.},
